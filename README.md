# AI-Movie-Recommender
Movie Matchmaker is a content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn. It uses genre similarity to suggest movies similar to a selected favorite, all wrapped in a cinematic, modern UI.

🚀 Overview
1. Built using TF-IDF Vectorization and linearKernel
2. Interactive front-end powered by Streamlit
3. Styled with custom HTML/CSS for a movie-themed aesthetic
4. Ideal for learning and showcasing basic AI + Web App integration

🧠 How It Works
1.	Movie genres are preprocessed and vectorized using TF-IDF.
2.	A linearKernel matrix is computed across all movie vectors.
3.	On user selection, the system retrieves the top N similar movies.
4.	The frontend displays recommendations in a stylized interface.
